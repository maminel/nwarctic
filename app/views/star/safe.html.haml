      %p Star students are busy. They thrive on our blend of academic, cultural and community activities. Students have full access to Kotzebue High Schoolâ€™s quality activities program, as well as special activities just for our residential community. Our teaching and residential staff are carefully chosen and thoroughly trained. We provide a positive environment and emphasize safety, academic support and student participation.
