      %p ATC students benefit from instruction in the workplace skills that employers expect.  We emphasize responsibility, excellent attendance, and positive collaboration in both the classroom and hands-on work settings.  Students earn Alaska WorkKeys certifications.  Those performing at the highest levels earn the Savakturuq (â€œworks diligently) certificate we have developed with the input of employers worldwide.
